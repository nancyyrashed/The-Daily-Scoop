      <h2> Nancy Rashed </h2>
      <br>
      <h3> Introduction: </h3>
      <h4> I wanted a website that contains a lot of different news to satisfy a majority of people so I choose to make a newspaper magazine that 
          <br>
          contains different topics and pages that attracts most of the people. The website contains 5 pages the first one is the main page which 
          <br>
          contain different news and isn’t just one topic it has some of the important things that you would need when you use a news magazine. The 
          <br>
          other 4 pages has 4 different topics which are sports, food, fashion and health. I choose those topics because they are what people search for
          <br>
          the most and want to get daily information about them and also tried to have different topics because not everyone think the same and love the 
          <br>
          same thing. So the website contains videos and photos to make it less boring and give you the whole idea.
      </h4>
      
      <br>
      <h3> Inspiration: </h3>
      <h4> What was behind my inspiration of creating a news magazine was wanting to provide people with most of the daily information they want to 
          <br>
          know in their day and share it with them in an easy way. Because I have been in a situation where I couldn’t reach the information I want 
          <br>
          from news magazines in an easy and fast way which annoyed me because when you search for information that means you want to find it as fast
          <br>
          as possible and not waste time as it might be really important. The websites that inspired when I was creating my website were CNN, Reuters,
          <br>
          Bloomberg, The globe and mail, The walt street journal and lastly New York times. I didn’t want to only get inspired by a website or two I 
          <br>
          wanted to get inspired by as many as possible of the most popular news magazines because they are popular for a reason and I wanted to get to 
          <br>
          know the reasons to do it in my own website. To provide a website that contains different design in each page as most of those websites had 
          <br>
          the same design for all the pages which I didn’t find that interesting.
      </h4>
      
      <br>
      <h3> Accessibility: </h3>
      <h4> The website has alt tags on images which make it accessible for people who are using screen readers or if the image can’t load or get 
          <br>
          displayed for them so in those cases it specifies what is the image. The website has a relaxing and light font to the eyes to make your eyes
          <br>
          feel comfortable reading the news and not get tired as you would take some time to read. It contains bold headers to make it easier to 
          <br>
          differentiate between the news and not get things mixed up. The colors of the website are simple and calm to make the user not feel like 
          <br>
          there is a lot of colors attacking his eyes and causing him distribution while reading.  
      </h4>
      
      <br>
      <h3> Usability: </h3>
      <h4> The website has a search bar to make it easier for the user to reach the information they need in the shortest time possible and make the 
          <br>
          process of finding something easy for them. There is a help menu at the bottom of the page and a bar list menu in the main page while in the 
          <br>
          other pages there is a three line menu that contains the same things in the bar list menu and also they have the same help menu in the bottom 
          <br>
          of all of the pages to make it easier to reach a specific part of the website that contains a specific topic and navigate easily between 
          <br>
          them. The website is responsive which mean it is usable for many devices as laptops, tablets, ipads and mobiles. Which makes it accessible 
          <br>
          and user friendly for a wide range of people. 
      </h4>
      
      <br>
      <h3> Learning: </h3>
      <h4> I had to learn how to insert a video in a website but it was really easy after I searched for it. I had to learn how to make a video gallery 
          <br>
          which was really challenging I learned this from a YouTube video that was smooth and explained it in a good way. I had to learn how to make 
          <br>
          an image slider which was also challenging but I learned it from a YouTube video and understood every part of it which made it easier. I also 
          <br>
          had to learn how to use bootstrap to help make my website responsive and at first I got the idea wrong so I had to redo a lot of things in 
          <br>
          the html and css until I got the hang of it and found how easy it was. Lastly I learned how to use media screen as it was confusing to me 
          <br>
          before.
      </h4>
      
      
      <br>
      <h3> Evaluation I: </h3>
      <h4> I think one of the things that worked for me the most was my website design as I made a wireframe for my website and started creating every 
          <br>
          part of it using html, CSS and JavaScript and got it to look in the way I wanted it to look in the first place with developing some parts as 
          <br>
          I was working on it. I was really happy with the image slider and video gallery as I think it was a smart idea to add them to make the 
          <br>
          website has different types of things and ways to show the information provided. Also I like that when you hover over a title or a paragraph 
          <br>
          or even some buttons it shows different colors that helps you differentiate between what you are hovering over and whether it is a title or a 
          <br>
          paragraph which makes it a better experience for the user.
      </h4>
      
      
      <br>
      <h3> Evaluation II: </h3>
      <h4> I think I should have used more media screen or even made the whole website using it as it would have made the responsive part look way 
          <br>
          better but I couldn’t use it for the whole pages as I am still not too good at using it so I didn’t want to risk it. I would have wanted to 
          <br>
          use more JavaScript in my code and make the website interact with the DOM but unfortunately, I didn’t do much of this as I couldn’t find many 
          <br>
          things that needs JavaScript to work in my design. Also I wanted to make the next page button turn into the next page of articles with the
          <br>
          same design but different 3 more news in the more news part but I couldn’t do that as I think it would have been counted as a whole page.
